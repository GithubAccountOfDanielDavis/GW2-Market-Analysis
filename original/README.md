# GW2-Market-Analysis
Backend, gather market information from GW2 api and perform predictive analysis

To use:
Download test_api_call_json.py
Download search.py
Store them in the same folder
Run test_api_call_json.py first
Run search.py if desired

TEST_API_CALL_JSON.PY:

At the moment the test_api_call_json.py file creates local databases containing information on all items, listed items, bank items,
materials storage items, and inventory items across all characters.

To access any of this information an API key is needed. When test_api_call_json.py is run it will prompt you for an API key. 
After you enter it, you may choose to update all databases, or just the ones needed to update the owned database.

NOTE: The all items, and listed items databases will take a fairly long time to create and update. A timer has been added
to ensure that they don't update more than once a week. This can be overridden when prompted, and is done automatically when 
the option to update owned databases is chosen.

SEARCH.PY:

To use this you must already have run the test_api_call_json.py file. This file allows you to search your owned items for
a specific item. It returns the total number of items in the bank, material storage and all characters, as well as the number 
of items in the bank, material storage, and all characters inventories.

NOTE: The item name or the item number must be entered EXACTLY. There is also no discrepancy between items of different rarity, 
the first version available in the database will be returned for items with multiple rarities. This should be fixed in the next
update.
